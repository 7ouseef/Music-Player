# Music-Player

## Problem Statement:
Develop a music player application that utilizes various data structures to efficiently 
manage and manipulate a large collection of music files. The application should allow 
users to search for songs, create playlists, and manage their recently played songs.

## Data Structure Concepts:

### 1. Linked List:
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. In this project, a linked list is used to implement playlists. Each node in the linked list represents a song in the playlist. The linked list allows for efficient insertion and deletion of songs from the playlist.

### 2. Stack:
A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. In this project, a stack is used to manage the recently played songs. The stack allows for efficient pushing and popping of songs onto and off the stack.

### 3. Tree: 
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. In this project, a tree can be used to represent the hierarchical organization of music genres and artists. The tree allows for efficient searching and browsing of music by genre and artist.

### 4. Hashing:
Hashing is a technique for mapping keys to values. In this project, hashing is used to efficiently store and retrieve data from the hash table. The hash function takes a key as input and generates a hash value, which is used to determine the location of the key in the hash table.
